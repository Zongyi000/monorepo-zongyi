# Use Case 2

<hr>

**Use Case**: Color Selection for Drawing

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To select a different color for drawing by pressing number keys 1 through 8.

**Preconditions**: The program is running, responsive, and the user is in the drawing mode.

**Trigger**: Pressing one of the number keys from 1 to 8 on the keyboard.
  
**Scenario**: 
Pressing '1' selects Black
Pressing '2' selects White
Pressing '3' selects Red
Pressing '4' selects Green
Pressing '5' selects Blue
Pressing '6' selects Yellow
Pressing '7' selects Magenta
Pressing '8' selects Cyan
 
**Exceptions**: If a key other than 1 through 8 is pressed, the system should ignore the input and continue using the currently selected color.

**Priority**: Medium-priority.

**When available**: First release

**Channel to actor**: The user interacts through an I/O device, specifically the keyboard. The system must respond instantly to the keyboard events, changing the drawing color as soon as a valid number key is pressed.

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: Consideration for users who are colorblind or have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. Future releases may need to incorporate more color selection options or a custom color palette feature.
